GENERATOR
     scaffold - create a model and basic controller

SYNOPSIS
     generate scaffold ModelName [action ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The scaffold generator takes the name of the new model as the
     first argument and an optional list of controller actions as the
     subsequent arguments.  Any actions with scaffolding code available
     will be generated in your controller; others will be left as stubs.

     The generated controller has the same code that "scaffold :model"
     uses, so it's easy to migrate when you want to start customizing
     your controller.

EXAMPLE
     ./script/generate scaffold Account debit credit

     This will generate the Account model with unit tests and fixtures,
     the AccountController controller with actions, views, and tests for
     index, list, show, new, create, edit, update, and destroy.

     Now create the accounts table in your database and browse to
     http://localhost/account/ -- voila, you're on Rails!
