NAME
     new_model - create model stub files

SYNOPSIS
     new_model ModelName

DESCRIPTION
     The new_model generator takes a model name (in CamelCase) and generates
     a new, empty model in app/models, a test suite in test/unit with one
     failing test case, and a fixtures directory in test/fixtures.

EXAMPLE
     new_model Account

     This will generate an Account class in app/models/account.rb, an
     AccountTest in test/unit/account_test.rb, and the directory
     test/fixtures/account.
