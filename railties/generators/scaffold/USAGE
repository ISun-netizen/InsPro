NAME
     new_scaffold - create a model and a skeleton controller

SYNOPSIS
     new_scaffold ModelName [action ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The new_scaffold generator takes the name of the new model as the
     first argument and an optional list of controller actions as the
     subsequent arguments.  Any actions with scaffolding code available
     will be generated in your controller; others will be left as stubs.

EXAMPLE
     new_scaffold Account

     This will generate an Account model and controller.
     Now create the accounts table in your database and browse to
     http://localhost/account/ -- voila, you're on Rails!
